      <h2>Project 1 How does hardware work</h2>
      <p>
        This project was carried out as part of the SITE 1101 course and aimed to develop a practical understanding of hardware by constructing basic logic gates such as NOT, AND, and OR using electronic components. As members of Group 26, we also worked with other teams to complete bonus tasks involving the construction of NAND and XOR gates. Through this project, I strengthened my knowledge of digital logic, gained hands-on experience with hardware fundamentals, and improved my teamwork skills.

      <h2>Portfolio Website for SITE 1101</h2>
      <p>
        This individual assignment was completed as part of the SITE 1101: Principles of Information Systems course. The project involved designing and developing a personal portfolio website to present my academic background, technical skills, and completed projects. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed through GitHub Pages. Throughout the development process, I gained hands-on experience with Git version control, writing clean and modular code, and implementing responsive design to ensure compatibility across desktop and mobile devices. The site features Home, About, and Projects sections, along with a navigation menu, footer, and direct links to my GitHub and Codecademy profiles.

      <h2>Optional: Hour of Code Activity</h2>
      <p>
        This team project was conducted for the SITE 1101 course within the framework of the Hour of Code / Hour of AI initiative. As members of Group 26, we delivered an educational workshop at Secondary School No. 161 for 20 participants. During the session, we introduced fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence and led students through interactive, hands-on activities using Bug Arena. Despite limited technological resources, we successfully engaged the students and shared our knowledge to spark their interest in computer science.
