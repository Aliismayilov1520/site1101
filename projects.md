      <h2>Project 1 &mdash; Simple Information System Concept</h2>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates a basic information system designed for a
        small fictional organization. The goal is to show how data can be
        captured, processed, and presented as useful information for decision
        makers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project includes a short problem description, a list of functional
        requirements, and an overview of how data moves through the system.
        Although the system is conceptual, it reflects the principles from
        SITE 1101: identifying inputs, processes, and outputs.

      <h2>Portfolio Website for SITE 1101</h2>
      <p>
        This website itself is an individual project for SITE 1101. It is built
        using HTML, CSS, and Jekyll, a static site generator. The portfolio
        applies information systems thinking to organize content in a clear and
        structured way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site uses reusable components for the navigation bar and footer, a
        layout system for pages, and a responsive design approach so that it
        works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

      <h2>Optional: Hour of Code Activity</h2>
      <p>
        As an optional extension, this project represents participation in an
        Hour of Code style activity. The focus is on developing basic logic
        and problem-solving skills using simple, visual programming exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        While not required for the course, this activity supports the broader
        goal of building confidence with computational thinking and algorithmic
        problem solving.
