## Background

I am a first-year student of Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a strong interest in information systems and technology. I enjoy learning how technical systems, data, and technology are designed and used to solve real-world problems. My focus is on building a solid foundation in engineering concepts while understanding how information systems support organizations and decision-making processes.


In this course, I am exploring core concepts such as systems thinking, business process modeling, data management, and the role of information systems in organizations.
