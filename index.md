      <h2>Hello, I’m an Information Systems student.</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio was created for
        <strong>SITE 1101: Principles of Information Systems</strong> to present
        my background, skills, and selected coursework projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in how organizations use technology to solve problems,
        improve processes, and support decision making. Through this course I am
        learning how information systems are designed, implemented, and
        evaluated in real-world contexts.
